        Each ability has a score, a number that defines the magnitue of that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average,
        but adventurers and many monsters are cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person
        usually reaches, but some creatures are known to have a score as high as 20.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 to +10. To determine an ability modifier subtract
        10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (rounding down).

        Ability modifiers affect many aspects of the game. The are used in <strong>attack rolls, ability checks, and saving
